# Python Script to Read Tightrope Report

Change the # of courses in line 12 of tightrope.py to how many should be completed total. 

Put the report csv (assuming it is titled reportData.csv) and tightrope.py in the same directory. 

If you have python installed locally, running python3 tightrope.py in the terminal will print out how many people have completed the training and who still needs to.
